# Zorkish
A partial remake of the classic Zork. 

## Features
- Fully-featured XML world loader that is capable of specifying room location, contents and description, the playerâ€™s location as well as the items and health they start with, trap location and damage, items that contain items, etc. As a result, the game contains absolutely zero world specification; instead the player is able to select which level to play based on what is found in the /worlds/ directory.
- Messaging, Announcements and Blackboards framework: A versatile and very easy to manage messaging system. So far only used by traps to determine when to trigger based on PlayerMovedMessages.
